Ultra-slow, collaborative, always on version of Tetris played on Discord (with emojis!!)  :egg: :blue_heart: :heart: :yellow_heart: :purple_heart: :tangerine: :snowflake:

# FAQ

	How Do I Start my game?
After adding the bot to your server, use the !TextrisInfo command to see more information and available commands for the game. The bot requires its own channel titled `textris` to receive game commands, like moving a piece. Additionally, it is helpful for there to be a channel where players can talk about the game (and it doesn't need a specific name!) Here, players can type out the info command, swap emojis, look over recently inputted commands, or change the hold threshold.

	My Game Isn't Working!/This isn't my textris board! 
First, check to make sure the bot is online. Unless the hosting platform is down or there is maintenance on the bot, this should not be the case. Use some bot commands like `!highlight` or `!l` or `!r` to make sure the game isn't responding. There are known issues involving some instances of the game to briefly appear differently (different boards, hold pieces missing, etc). This should go away within a second of appearing and not affect the logic of your game. 

	I can't swap emojis or change the hold threshold! 
Make sure that users wishing to do that have the `textris mod` role.
